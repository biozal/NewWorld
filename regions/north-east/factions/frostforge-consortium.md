# The Frostforge Consortium

The Frostforge Consortium is a hardy and industrious faction of dwarves who have made their home in the frigid northern mountains of the world of Glaciera. Over generations, these dwarves have adapted to the harsh climate and have built a thriving society based on mining, metalworking, and trade. The organization was established to facilitate trade with the people of the southern regions, offering high-quality dwarven craftsmanship and valuable minerals in exchange for food, textiles, and other goods not readily available in their mountainous homeland.

The Frostforge Consortium has become renowned for their exceptional skills in smithing and gem-cutting, as well as their ability to navigate the treacherous mountain passes that separate their homeland from the southern lands. Their reputation as skilled traders and craftsmen has earned them the respect and admiration of the people they trade with, and their goods are highly sought after in the markets of the south.
