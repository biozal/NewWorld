The Arcanum Conclave is a prestigious and esteemed faction in the south, dedicated to nurturing and guiding those gifted in the arcane arts. Founded several centuries ago by a visionary assembly of wizards, sorcerers, and warlocks, the organization was created to foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing among the magically inclined, regardless of their origin or background.

Recognizing the vast potential and power of arcane magic, the founding members of the Arcanum Conclave sought to create a sanctuary where the magically gifted could study and hone their abilities without fear of persecution or prejudice. They constructed a grand academy, the Arcanum Spire in Cumming, in a remote and secure location, hidden from the prying eyes of those who might fear or exploit the power of the arcane.

Over time, the Arcanum Conclave earned a reputation for excellence and became the premier destination for aspiring spellcasters from all corners of Mystara. The faction's members are dedicated to advancing the understanding and practice of magic, both for the betterment of society and the pursuit of personal mastery.

The Arcanum Conclave is governed by a council of archmages, each an expert in their respective field of magic. These esteemed individuals are responsible for shaping the curriculum and overseeing the organization's various research projects and magical endeavors. The faction maintains an extensive network of allies and contacts among magical communities and organizations, ensuring they remain at the forefront of arcane discovery and innovation.
