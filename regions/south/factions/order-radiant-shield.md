The Order of the Radiant Shield is a revered and influential faction in the south, dedicated to maintaining peace and justice across the region. Established over a century ago by a group of noble paladins and enlightened aristocrats, the organization was created in response to the rising tide of chaos and lawlessness that threatened to engulf the land.

United by their commitment to upholding the principles of honor, righteousness, and benevolence, the founding members of the Order of the Radiant Shield set out to establish a beacon of hope for the people of the south. They established strongholds and training grounds across the region, where aspiring paladins and champions of justice could hone their skills and pledge their allegiance to the cause.  The city of Atlanta has given the Order of Radiant Shield special powers to help the local city guards maintain peace in the city.

Over time, the Order of the Radiant Shield gained widespread recognition and respect for their unwavering dedication to protecting the innocent and preserving the peace. Their reputation spread far and wide, attracting members from various backgrounds, including clerics, fighters, and even a few repentant rogues seeking redemption.

The faction operates through a network of knights, diplomats, and agents who work in concert to quell unrest, mediate disputes, and defend the realm from both internal and external threats. They often collaborate with local governments and other organizations in their quest for justice and are known for their unyielding resolve in the face of adversity.
