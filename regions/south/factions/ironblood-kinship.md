The Ironblood Kinship is a fierce and traditionalist faction, comprised of orcs who reject the encroachment of technology and magic on their ancient way of life. Formed several generations ago by a group of orcs disillusioned with the rapid spread of magical and technological advancements, the organization was established to preserve their tribe's ancestral customs and beliefs.  The tribe started out in the central plains before expanding into the southern regions.

The Ironblood Kinship orcs view the use of technology and most magic as a corruption of their culture and a threat to the natural order. They believe in living in harmony with nature and upholding the old ways, which emphasize physical strength, endurance, and martial prowess. The only form of magic they accept is healing magic, which they consider to be a divine gift that aids them in their quest to maintain the purity of their traditions.

The faction is led by a council of respected elders and warriors, who are responsible for guiding the organization's efforts to preserve their culture and resist the spread of technology and arcane knowledge. The Ironblood Kinship is known for their ferocity in battle and their unwavering dedication to their cause, often clashing with other factions and settlements that embrace the use of magic and technology.
