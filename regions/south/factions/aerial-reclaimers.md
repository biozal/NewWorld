# The Aerial Reclaimers

The Aerial Reclaimers is a determined and secretive faction in the world of New World, composed of Kenku who are desperate to regain their lost ability to fly and speak. Formed generations ago by a group of Kenku mystics and scholars, the organization was established to seek out ancient knowledge, artifacts, and powerful magic that might help them reverse the curse that has plagued their race for centuries.

Bound by their shared desire to regain their wings and voices, the Aerial Reclaimers have adopted a single-minded and often ruthless approach to achieving their goals. The organization is willing to do whatever it takes to break the curse, even if it means engaging in activities that other races might consider evil or illegal. They have been known to steal valuable artifacts, kidnap skilled spellcasters, and even make pacts with dark powers in their quest for a solution.

The Aerial Reclaimers are led by a council of Kenku elders, who are responsible for guiding the organization's efforts and coordinating its various activities. Their desperation to regain their flight and speech has driven them to the fringes of society, and their activities are shrouded in secrecy and subterfuge.

The city of Miami serves as the major base of operations for the Aerial Reclaimers, although they are known to have satellite operations in most of the cities in the south.
