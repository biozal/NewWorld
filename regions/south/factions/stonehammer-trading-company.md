# The Stonehammer Trading Company

The Stonehammer Trading Company is a prosperous and resourceful faction of dwarves who dwell in the northern mountains around Chattanooga. These dwarves have developed a thriving society based on mining, craftsmanship, and trade, connecting their mountainous homeland to the fertile southern regions. The organization was established to foster trade with the southern people, offering masterfully crafted dwarven goods and valuable minerals in exchange for food, textiles, and other essential resources not readily available in their mountain homes.

The Stonehammer Trading Company is renowned for their exceptional skills in metalworking, stonemasonry, and gem-cutting, as well as their ability to navigate the challenging mountain passes to maintain their trade routes. Their reputation as skilled craftsmen and reliable traders has earned them the respect and admiration of the people they trade with, and their goods are highly prized in the markets of the south.
