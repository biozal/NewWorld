## Introduction

### Origins of the New World

The continent of New World was originally ruled by the Dragons and Giants.  These creatures began to conflict with each other which eventually broke out into the first war, which some call the Great War.  During this time many artifacts from both races were lost and the number of Giants and Dragons were greatly reduced. 

The continent of New World was discovered by a group of light skinned humans and elves from the land of Europe over 950 years ago (BT - Before Titans War) when they settled the East Coast in New York.  Word from the old land spread and a separate group of mostly Elves and a small amount of dwarves, gnomes, halfings, and dark skinned humans settled California and the west coast from Asia.  

The New World became a challenge as the land was already inhabited by:

- Dragons
- Giants
- Tabaxi
- Kenku
- Lizardfolk
- Orc
- Yuan-ti Pureblood
- Dwarves
- Elves
- Many monsters 

The elves on the West Coast started two major regions and communities, one named Seattle and the other called Los Angeles. The native elves to the lands did not agree with the ownership of land and when battle broke out between them, they were driven underground along with the original dwarves of the lands, starting the Drow race of elves and the Duergar race of dwarves.  

On the East Coast the humans and various races settled into New York and then moved up and down the East Coast settling in large towns like Boston Philadelphia, and Baltimore.  

The races from the East Coast not happy with the land they had started to move westward toward the west coast and settled in Michigan, the Dakotas, and parts of Canada.

### The New Gods

While most of the history was lost during the Titan Wars, what is understood is that a group of humans, dwarves, elves discovered some ancient artifacts that allowed the old gods (Titans) to walk the lands.  The titans started to gain the flaws of the people that walked the lands like greed and this eventually started the Titan wars.  This war ravaged the land and most of the cities were greatly destroyed.  The cloud giants seeing this happening and fearing all history would be lost fled to Eshiya and created the "Rift", a magical barrier in the middle of the ocean that restricts anyone from entering the land of the Old World.

The people of the New World unable to flee back to the Old World were left to suffer and many lives were lost.  A band of adventures listed below found the courage to make a deal with the Dragons and Giants to use ancient artifacts to destroy the Titans, thus returning the lands to peace.  The group of adventures were:

- Paltar (Human Paladin leader)
- Mxyzpixel (Halfling Rogue)
- Bladebeard (Dwarf paladin)
- Small Paw (Tabaxi Rogue)
- Hattik (Human Mage)
- Silvanus (twin sister of Thymisis Ranger)
- Thymisis (twin sister of Silvanus Ranger)

In order to kill and lock the Titans from never returning the group of adventures had to give there souls to kill the Titans.  As apart of this banishment there souls were transferred to the plane that the original Titans came from.  

## Dragons

The dragons of the world didn't fair well and there numbers before the wars were over 20,000.  While no one knows how many are left, but the Elves of Seattle whom track the modern history of the lands estimate there numbers are less than 1,000.  The known Dragons in the lands have been spotted around:

- San Francisco, Georgia, Michigan (Blue Dragons)
- New Mexico, Floridia (Red Dragons)
- Canada (Blue/White Dragons)
- Maine, Oregon, Kentucky (Green Dragon)

It is rumored that the lands to the south (Centeral and South America) are were most of the dragons make home with rumors of large beasts in jungles called Dinosaurs that they feed off of.

## Giants

### Frost Giants

The Frost Giants of the lands fled far north Canada and are rarely spotted unless adventures move north of the dark lands of the Dakotas, Minnesota, Michigan, Maine, northen parts of Wisconsin.  It is recorded in the year 282 AT a large force of Frost Giants attacked the city of Seattle and in the results several pre-war artifacts were lost along with most of the city including the great library of history which was one of the only last records of times before the war.  The Frost Giants claimed the elves were hiding a great artifact that originally belonged to them from them.  This broke the peace between the people of the New World and the Frost Giants.

### Hill Giants

The Hill Giants roam the central plains.  Before the Titan Wars, the Hill Giants were as intelligent as the Cloud Giants with the strength of the Fire Giants.  The Hill Giants started the treaty between the humans and the Giants in order to stop the Titans.  The friendship grew between the two and eventually a race of beings called the Golaiths was started when humans started to mate with the Hill Giants.  The titans fearing this relationship would destroy them cursed all Hill Giants, taking there size, strength, and intelligence from them.  Since the fall of the titans and the end of the Titan War, many of them have banded with Hobgoblins, Goblins, and Bug Bears to take the lands from the honorable Orc and Goliath tribes.

### Fire Giants

The Fire Giants are rumored to have a great fortress in the Rocky Mountains. Not much is known about them and very people that have seen them have lived to tell. 

### Cloud Giants

The Cloud Giants fled the lands during the Titan war and created the Rift, a magical barrier in the oceans to the east and west that lock the people in the New Lands from being able to return to the Old Lands.

### Storm Giants

Much is not known about them other than they are the most powerful of the giants and in ancient times had a palace called Atlantis that scholars state is located somewhere in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

## Current

The date is 1120 AT (After Titans).  Much records of time were lost and very little is known about the times of before the War of Titans.  The original titans went to world with the new gods, giants and dragons.  This war lasted over 100 years and most of the lands were greatly destroyed in the process, with over 98% of the worlds population lost in the war.

450 years following the war, the world population started to recover, relationships between the races started to mend, and cities started to pop-up around the lands.  

In routes between some cities are still very dangerous and most traveling caravans require adventures or hired mercenaries to protect them from the new evil monsters and forces that stock the lands.
